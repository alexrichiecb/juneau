        <h3>Bipolar Diagnosis Story</h3>
        <p class="article">There’s a huge power in diagnosis. To finally get the answers about whatever issue has been haunting you; all too often for a while before you seek the help you need. In my case, that was finally understanding why I have been such an emotional rollercoaster for the past years— Ms. Bipolar had decided to crash my party. She, however, is a sneaky one. She often goes unnoticed, especially when she presents in her second form as she does for me. You often will try out treatments for the regular old depression blues but they won’t work, well this may be why. I just want to put a disclaimer before I dig into the details of my story this article is not meant to be a diagnosis but rather an informative piece that may help you recognize some potential signs of bipolar in yourself or another. With that being said, let’s get into it.
	I am fortunate that I wasn’t born this way. I had an extremely good childhood. It’s always something that I reflect on with a bittersweet lens— that I had all of those years filled with such happy memories. However, as much as I thought this state of euthymia would last forever, my colorful and exciting world would soon plunge into a dark grayscale.
<br>
	I was facing an all too familiar middle school-caliber obstacle: bullying. I am also on the autism spectrum, so I never have been one to keep up with the trends or fashions of the time, which you can imagine in our luxurious day and age, opened me up for a ton of ridicule. I had a lot of interests that diverged from my peers, instead of being into sports like the other boys, I was into writing books about personified microbes and immune cells and reading them to the class, oblivious to their boredom. Although I was completely unaware of all of the criticism being thrown at me, until one day. That was the day my first major depressive episode  began. The negative light in which everyone around had been viewing me became very clear. But even after I collected myself and returned to class that down feeling that had beset me did not leave. And it wouldn’t for months.
	<br>
	For the majority of that summer, I couldn’t get out of my head all of the interactions with my classmates which I had realized were persecutory. It drained every ounce of energy and motivation I had. I was in a summer camp that I had been looking forward to attending for a while but suddenly it didn’t seem so exciting anymore. The downward departure from my typical self became so evident that my parents began to catch on. I remember my dad was lecturing me on the way to this camp and told me I better not be thinking about hurting myself, which poked the deepest-darkest thoughts I had been having, and caused me to have a spontaneous breakdown right there in the passenger seat of the car. In addition to those hallmark depression symptoms, I also began to become extremely abrasive, misinterpreting even the smallest of jokes as a deep emotional attack, another dimorphism in incongruence with my normal self. Luckily, however, this bout of sadness only lasted a few months when I learned to (somewhat) better cope with the events that had ensued before at school. However, I had only merely climbed a short hill of the rollercoaster, and that was to pick up potential energy to sail right back down. I was 13 years old at this time and I was outed to my Christian family as gay after getting into a fight with a former friend. 
<br>
	I feel like now would be the time to mention why I didn’t catch onto the fact that this was a mental illness going on. A lot of the time, when you have a stressful or weighing presence in your life, it can make a lot of your emotional anguish seem somewhat situational and this can be very true for some, situational depression is a very real and prevalent problem. Notwithstanding this fact, clinical depression can also present itself at these kinds of trying times. The key difference is that while situational depression peters out when the stressful event ends, clinical or “major” depression does not.
	<br>
		Now I want to get into when I was 15 years old because this is when my bipolar began to kick into gear. I remember it distinctly. I was a freshman in high school at the time, I woke up on what seemed like a normal day, took my daily shower, got dressed, and did everything else to get ready for school. Only, when I got to the bus stop, something felt unusual. I felt— energized in a way. Like I was on top of the world, not to be too corny or cliché of bipolar. I hadn’t felt anywhere close to this in years and I never had felt exactly like this ever. But I was going to go with it. I started plotting out a bunch of hobbies and activities I had recently wanted to do but did not have the energy to accomplish. And when I got to school I started doing them. I remember participating in class way more than normal, studying all the tenses in Spanish from a grammar book we had in class, and just completing work at a way faster rate than normal. My creativity also spiked during this time, if I’m not mistaken, allowing me to add a whole new element of originality to my work.
	<br>
	I knew this wasn’t normal but it definitely was way better than what I had been going through for the past few years and it made me think I had beat my depression; sadly though, this high was not to last. After about three days, I dove right back down to my normal state.
<br>
		Because of the mild nature of what I now understand to be a hypomanic episode, it sort of flew under the radar as being such. I had known what bipolar was at the time but I also had known people with the disorder and I wasn’t nearly as debilitated as them so I couldn’t be that.
	<br>
		Fast forward, to the pandemic came, which was a period of depression as it was for many. So nothing too exciting happened during that time as far as I can remember except in August of 2021, I entered my first year of college. I also did start my antidepressant treatment at this time, which was a lifesaver. I finally regained the motivation that I had lost over the years and finished out the academic year with impressive marks compared to what they had been before Prozac.
	<br>
		This is when I transferred to Vanderbilt. I was well off for the most part, that was until the end of a turbulent relationship of mine during the middle of the summer 2023 semester. Suddenly, the stress load of everyday life couldn’t be carried by my Wellbutrin and Prozac anymore, and this was the first time I was committed to a psychiatric hospital for my symptoms. Which, I know firsthand how scary it can be. But if you’re ever down in the dumps as much as I was, it can make a huge difference. It provides you with a quiet and safe place, separated from the situations causing you distress, with people to tend to your issues going on. I’m not saying this will be everyone’s experience but this is the one I had at Vanderbilt’s PAS. 
<br>
		They also can tweak your medication schedule, which they did for me. They put me on Abilify to augment my former treatment, which thank god they did because my final hypomanic episode was to follow and the worst one yet. Without the Abilify, it probably would have been way more intense than it was. Once again, my productivity skyrocketed (which was great for the beginning of the fall semester) but this time around, I knew there was definitely something wrong with what was ensuing. My whole body was shaking, my energy was so high that I couldn’t sit in one place for more than ten minutes, and I was indeed completing my work but doing so by jumping from task to task as if I had some kind of attention deficit. This time, however, I was set up with an amazing psychiatrist and therapist from the UCC since I had been experiencing depression beforehand. They were able to witness the presentation of this episode in our weekly appointments and provide me with coping skills to deal with it during its duration and the imminent crash of its ending. For any of you who may be experiencing or know yourself to be experiencing a hypomanic or even full-blown manic episode, I implore you to try out anxiety techniques such as diaphragmatic or square breathing. While bipolar and anxiety definitely aren’t the same, the activation of the nervous system during hypomania can be somewhat tamed with grounding skills, at least temporarily.
<br>
		After telling them about my history with these cyclic moods and witnessing it themselves between weeks when I would come into the office, I was diagnosed with Bipolar II. This was uncharted territory for me. I was the first one in my family to ever be diagnosed with the disorder. I also pick up medication sometimes when I go back home to Massachusetts, so I had to give my parents the update since we go to the pharmacy together while on walks and run all of our errands there at once. They were shocked, to say the least, because of the aforementioned reason. But as of now, I am lucky to be able to talk to them about my treatment and how it is proceeding. My friends had been long suspecting this diagnosis along with me; I talk to them all of the time, so, they knew everything that was going on.
<br>
		I tapered off of my old antidepressants and started a new one along with my mood stabilizer. The transition period was most definitely difficult but I encourage any of you who are starting or changing psychotropic medications to not get discouraged and to stay on your daily schedule. It can take 6-8 weeks for the medication to fully absorb and have its true effects on your system; as I write this article now, my mood is just starting to return to a normal or “euthymic” frame where I am in the goldilocks zone of productive and energized. Things still are not perfect but with treatment, I have gotten to a point where I can live my life as normally as possible.
<br>
	Depression and Bipolar really aren’t as uncommon and invisible as they may seem. We may be at a university with prestige but always remember that mental illness doesn’t discriminate. We’re all working toward the same goal of learning as much as we can and walking across the stage, though a lot of us do have obstacles to overcome in the process. The person walking by you near Rand or sitting next to you in class could be in my boat or yours. So just remember, you never know what may be going on behind closed doors in someone’s life. But also, let’s continue working towards a culture where we don’t have to keep these kinds of struggles in the closet.
